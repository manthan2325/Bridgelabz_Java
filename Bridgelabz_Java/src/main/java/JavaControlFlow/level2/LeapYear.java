/*
 Problem 1 - GCR Control Flow Level 2
 * Write a LeapYear program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a
 * Leap Year or not a Leap Year.
 * Hint =>
 * The LeapYear program only works for year >= 1582, corresponding to a year in
 * the Gregorian calendar. So ensure to check for the same.
 * Further, the Leap Year is a Year divisible by 4 and not 100 unless it is
 * divisible by 400. E.g. 1800 is not a Leap Year and 2000 is a Leap Year.
 * Write code having multiple if else statements based on conditions provided
 * above and a second part having only one if statement and multiple logical
 *
